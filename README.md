# RICA-Remastered

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

The structure of how we'll work is what we did
[earlier](<(https://github.com/TeamRocketBalleBalle/Ricktionary)>). In separate
branches for individual pieces of work.

> **Note to Evaluator:** Our repository has more branches than `main` branch
> where code for those specific things is being developed. Those branches will
> have the latest commits than this `main` branch and you are encouraged to
> check those branches out too. \
> Once code has been developed for that particular category, it will be merged onto
> main.

## Setting up dev environment

1. install `pre-commit` \
   `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
2. Set up `pre-commit` as a "pre-commit hook" \
   `pre-commit install --install-hooks`

## Stuff to keep in mind:

-   Always pull before you start editing code
-   **DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO `main` BRANCH**
-   We'll be doing the development work on the `development` branch and `main`
    will be used to mark significant releases. \
     When your respective work is done, open a Pull Request from your branch to
    `development` branch.

    (Just like [last time](https://github.com/TeamRocketBalleBalle/Ricktionary))
