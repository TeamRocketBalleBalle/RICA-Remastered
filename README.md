# RICA-Remastered

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

The structure of how we'll work is not decided yet, but when we figure it out,
this part of README will be updated

## Setting up dev environment

1. install `pre-commit` \
   `pip install pre-commit`
2. Set up `pre-commit` as a "pre-commit hook" \
   `pre-commit install --install-hooks`

## Stuff to keep in mind:

-   Always pull before you start editing code
-   **DO NOT DIRECTLY COMMIT TO `main` BRANCH**
-   We'll be doing the development work on the `development` branch and `main`
    will be used to mark significant releases. \
     When your respective work is done, open a Pull Request from your branch to
    `development` branch.

    (Just like [last time](https://github.com/TeamRocketBalleBalle/Ricktionary))
