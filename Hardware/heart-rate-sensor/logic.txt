EVENT:
	- connected to wifi
	- no SSID available
	- connect failed (assuming this means that credentials are wrong)
	- disconnected


logic overview:
	- wifi check?
		- credentials exist?
		- wifi connect? {what if wifi is off}
		- credentials valid?


	- start hotspot [if wifi check failed]
		- hotspot start
		- server registers credential only api

	- wifi check = true and hotspot on every 5 seconds
		- [api] status
		- [api] close/ok/ack
			- close hotspot
			- restart the server with default api

	- in 5s 3 times button then cCOIMEPTLEPTLE reset ezp

CASES:
	- credential invalid? (wipe the storage? global var?)
	- wifi is off
		- start hotspot,
		- ready to accept new credentials

GLOBAL VARIALBE:
	- status
		- connecting
		- invalid_credentials
		- client_close_ack
permanent:
	- cred_valid

TODO:
    - instead of WiFi.status(), register event handlers
